# I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists,
# albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# Afterwards, I performed analytics on the dataset using SQL.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
--Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#3. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#4. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

#5. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.FirstName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

#6. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#7. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#8. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT track.name, invitem.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS track
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS invitem
ON track.TrackId = invitem.TrackId

#9. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#10. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name as Track, alb.Title as Album_Title,  m.Name as Media_Type , g.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks as t
JOIN chinook.albums as alb
ON alb.AlbumID = t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types as m
ON m.MediaTypeID = t.MediaTypeID
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres as g
ON g.GenreID = t.GenreID

#11. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.employees as emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepID
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#12. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.employees as emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepID
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;

#13. What was the most popular album sold in 2009?
