# I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists,
# albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# Afterwards, I performed analytics on the dataset using SQL.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, 
--Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#3. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#4. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

#5. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.FirstName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

#6. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
